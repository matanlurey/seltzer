  An elegant and rich cross-platform HTTP library for Dart.

  Unlike most HTTP libraries, most things in Seltzer are a Stream not a Future,
  this allows extensibility, and adding features like local caching, easy.

  Seltzer is based loosely on the "superagent" package for NodeJs
  (https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) and the "streamy" package for
  Dart (https://github.com/google/streamy-dart).
